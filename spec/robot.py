"""milli, a microduck-sized biped on Feetech STS3215 legs: the one source of truth for kinematics, servos, masses
and outer shape.

Run `python -I spec/robot.py` to write spec/robot.json, which the offline checks, the robot-file writer and the
Fusion build all read. Never hand-edit robot.json or the Fusion document: change this file and rebuild.

Frame: metres, X forward, Y left, Z up, floor at z = 0. Zero pose: standing with straight legs, head level, beak
shut. All geometry is written in WORLD coordinates at the zero pose. Each link's frame sits at its parent joint's
origin with world-aligned axes. The left leg is written once; the right is its mirror (y -> -y).

The look is Pollen Robotics' microduck (2026-11-02, the user: "looks of microduck for sure"): a big rounded hood
of a head with one eye and an orange bill on a neck of bare servos, a small white body, bare black servos at the
hips and knees, orange shoes on yellow soles. Its joint layout too (leg: hip yaw, roll, pitch, knee, ankle; head:
neck pitch, head pitch, head yaw, head roll, beak). Its servos are not: the hips and knees are Feetech STS3215s,
the SO-101 arm's servo, ankles too; the neck and head ROBOTIS XC330/XL330s (spec/actuators.json). The servo cases are the
structure: each sits in its parent link with its horn on the joint axis; printed plates join horn to case.

Geometry roles (as echo's, the repo this method is forked from):
  shell     outer cover (printed PLA). May overlap the shells and parts of ADJACENT links.
  decal     cosmetic surface detail (the eye). Must touch its link.
  struct    rigid internal part (printed bracket, battery, boards). Must not overlap rigid parts of any other link.
  actuator  bought servo case. Rigid. Lives in the joint's PARENT link, its shaft on the joint axis.
