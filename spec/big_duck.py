"""A duck taller than echo, on echo's RobStride actuators: python -I spec/big_duck.py -> spec/robot_big.json. Then MILLI_RECIPE=big for the tools.

The small duck's joints and look at 1.80 m (2026-11-03, the user: "use the powerful servos we used on echo humanoid and build me a duck bigger than echo"; "full design first...
including connection parts, bearings, screws"; "they can be metal parts if needed for the strength"; "you can't give a gigantic 3d printed part that can't fit in a Bambu printer").
Not the small duck scaled up: at this size the load goes through metal, not printed brackets.

Choices, and why:
- Frame: 6061 and 7075 plate, cut flat and bolted, so a waterjet service can make every metal part from one sheet thickness. Printed parts carry no load.
- Skin: 3 mm PETG panels, bolted to the frame, each inside a 256 mm printer bed (tools/checks.py 'printable'). Split where it shows least, along the hood's and body's lines.
- Hip roll and hip pitch: a pair of RS04s on one axis, each side of the part they turn. 240 N m peak, without gearing, and no moment on either output.
- Knee: a pair of RS04s, each with a crank, a rod and a lever on the knee, as Agility's Cassie and Digit drive theirs by pushrod. 1.54:1 at its weakest (mid stroke), 2.56:1 at the straight end,
  over 70 deg, from -0.92 (bent) to +0.30. The crank never passes dead centre. Rod load about 2 kN mid stroke, more toward the ends: a hand estimate, from before the rod's length changed.
- Head pitch: one RS04 through #40 roller chain, 13T to 25T, 1.92:1: +-1.6 rad is too far for a crank. The chain carries about 3 kN at peak against 14 kN to break it. The cost: backlash.
- No head roll (2026-11-03, the user: forget the flip, lower the upper body's weight): the head pitch went from a pair to one RS04, and the upper frames are lighter. Those masses are pocketing fills, assumed:
  no pockets are drawn and nothing has been stress-checked.
- Hip yaw: one RS04, as it turns the leg but doesn't hold it up: a 61824 thin-section bearing round the stator takes the leg's moment off the actuator's own bearing.
- Knees and head pitch ride on 6908 bearings in the frame; RS04 outputs carry only torque where a far bearing is given.
- Feet: an aluminium plate, printed TPU soles in two pieces. The stance is narrower than the small duck's in proportion, as a foot further out loads the hip roll more.

NOT SAFE TO BUILD. About 100 kg and 1.8 m, with no stress analysis, metal frames nobody has checked and joints that drop when power goes (no brakes): a failure could seriously hurt someone. See docs/big/BOM.md, "Open before ordering".

Not checked here: stress in the plates and shafts (a hand estimate only), chain tension and fatigue, heat, and how it survives a fall. Actuator numbers are the retailer's or maker's: confirm before ordering.
The real actuators (2026-11-05): RobStride's STEP files, read in Fusion and as text (they stay in %TEMP%/figrefs/robstride, not in the repo: python -I tools/fetch_servo_cad.py). The numbers in RS below come from there. A real one has not been measured.
Every stator hangs by the shoulder its rear step leaves, through a plate with a bore for the step and a window for the cable, and every output carries a flange with holes for its 3 pins. So the old "plate on a rear face" is gone. Fit is what's been checked, not strength.
