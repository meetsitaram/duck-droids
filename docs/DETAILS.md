# duck-droids: the details

The other ducks, how they compare, and what is still open. For the current build, start at the [README](../README.md).

## The family

![A 1.8 m white duck walking behind four small coloured ducks, each labelled with its servos, their beaks opening in turn](images/family/duck_family.gif)

The family ([MP4, 17 s, sharper](images/family/duck_family.mp4)). In simulation only: nothing here has been built. Each walk was recorded in physics and replayed at its real speed, told 0.3 m/s (the big duck 0.4). Some of it isn't what it looks like:
the beaks are scripted animation, as the policies keep them shut. Yellow and blue get up with the hybrid's stand-up, not their own. Pink has no trained walk yet and replays the hybrid's, scaled.
The big duck's walk uses a stepping clock, and this one overloads its knee: see [A big duck](#a-big-duck).

An early milli policy in MuJoCo ([MP4, 12 s, sharper](images/walk/milli_walk.mp4)), from iteration 1750 of 3000, before the fixes in
[LESSONS.md](../LESSONS.md): it circles. The finished walks go straight: see the table below. Simulation only. [Train it yourself](TRAINING.md).

## Four servo recipes

One design on four sets of servos, drawn at the same scale, to compare in simulation on walking, the head roll and getting up after a
fall. A case study you can rerun or add to: pick one with `MILLI_RECIPE`, or add your own to `RECIPES` in [spec/robot.py](../spec/robot.py).

![The four recipes front on at one scale, with height, width, weight and servos: all Dynamixel 29.8 cm tall, 14.7 cm wide, 0.89 kg; Feetech HD-1910 29.5 cm, 14.1 cm, 0.93 kg; hybrid 32.1 cm, 17.4 cm, 1.51 kg; all Feetech 37.7 cm, 17.4 cm, 1.85 kg](images/recipes/recipes.png)

Microduck, for scale: 26.4 cm tall, 14.1 cm wide on its model, 0.8 kg as published, on XL330s.

- **Nothing here has been built or tested on real parts.** Hybrid is the design the rest of this README, the parts list and the printable
  files describe. All Dynamixel has its own [parts list](dynamixel/BOM.md), [printable files](../prints/dynamixel/README.md) and [CAD](../cad/duck-droids-dynamixel.f3d), but changed after its walks were trained. The other two are spec-only drafts.
- **All Dynamixel** runs its XL330s straight off a 2S pack, as microduck's trainer models its own, which is past ROBOTIS's 6 V maximum. Its
  torque and speed at that voltage are estimates.
- **Feetech HD-1910** is the servo most community Microduck builds use, and is rated to 8.4 V, so it stays inside the maker's limits. Its numbers are a seller's sheet (+/- 10 %; the maker's own lists less torque), and its motor friction and inertia, and position gain, are estimates. No part of those builds is used here.
- **All Feetech** passes its checks only with looser limits, set in the spec: a higher mass budget, proportions within 15 % rather than 10 %, a
  smaller head roll range, and one pose (the floor pick) it can't reach.
- Masses are estimates from each part's material. Pictures: `python tools/render_recipes.py`.

Results so far, in simulation only, from 64 robots with the training's randomization on. Speeds are what they reached:

| Walk, final checkpoint (3000) | Told 0.1 / 0.2 / 0.3 / 0.4 m/s forward | Backward 0.2 | Sideways 0.2 | Turn 1.0 rad/s |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Hybrid | 0.10 / 0.19 / 0.26 / 0.31 | 0.11 | 0.06 | 0.94 |
| All Dynamixel | 0.00 / 0.16 / 0.22 / 0.25 | 0.00 | | 0.98 |
| Feetech HD-1910 | 0.05 / 0.16 / 0.24 / 0.33 | 0.14 | 0.06 | 0.92 |
| All Feetech | not trained yet | | | |

- **All Dynamixel** freezes at the slowest speed and doesn't go backward.
- **Getting up:** the hybrid, at iteration 3000 of a stopped run, gets up 100 % of the time from face down, face up and sitting, but in 0.2-0.55 s, too
  fast to trust on real servos, with small overlaps in 4-5 of 200 frames. The other recipes aren't trained on it yet.
- **The head roll:** set aside. No policy does it: all Dynamixel, the only recipe that reached 3000 iterations on it, turned 35 degrees at best. Scripted
  searches (`tools/flip_search.py`) didn't get a clean flip either.

## Hobby servos

A fifth recipe, spec only (`MILLI_RECIPE=hobby`): the same duck on cheap one-way PWM servos, driven by a PCA9685 (Adafruit's PWM / Servo Bonnet) on the Pi, with the Pi, the
board, the IMU, the battery and two 6 V BECs all in the body. MG996Rs at the hips, hip yaw, ankles and head pitch; DS3218s at the knees and the neck pitch, where an MG996R's
torque falls short; MG90Ss at the head's yaw, roll and beak. Its [parts list](hobby/BOM.md), [wiring](hobby/WIRING.md), [build order](hobby/ASSEMBLY.md) and
[printable files](../prints/hobby/README.md) come from its spec, with every check passing; nothing is built, printed or measured, and no walk is trained.

- **Size:** about 37 cm and 1.9 kg, past the 30-35 cm asked: the two standard-size neck servos stand end to end with their ears facing, 77 mm between the pitch axes. Its proportions are held within 15 %, as the all-Feetech duck's.
- **How they're held:** a hobby servo has no screw holes in its faces and no rear shaft. Each sits in a tray by its 4 ears, on printed rims; the far side of a fork turns on a printed hub in a bearing.
- **No feedback:** a PWM servo reports nothing. A policy trained on joint positions would have to be fed what it commanded. Untested.
- **Estimated, to measure:** the servos' ears, shaft offsets and case heights (no maker's drawing labelled them), every hobby servo's "rated" torque (a third of stall, assumed), the DS3218's and MG90S's stall currents, the leads' mass.

## A big duck

The same duck at 1.8 m, taller than [echo](https://github.com/meetsitaram/echo), on RobStride RS04 actuators, to test whether the method scales: a full design first, with
metal frames, bearings, screws and printed panels that fit a 256 mm bed, from its own spec, [spec/big_duck.py](../spec/big_duck.py) (`MILLI_RECIPE=big`).

**Not safe to build.** About 100 kg, with no stress analysis, unchecked metal frames, no real actuator measured and no brakes: a failure could seriously hurt someone. Its [BOM](big/BOM.md), [wiring](big/WIRING.md) and [Fusion trial](big/FUSION.md) are paper, and list what stays open.

![The big duck from the front and side, and a close-up of its neck with one head pitch actuator on a chain](images/big/big_duck.png)

![Its knee drawn to scale at three angles: a crank on the actuator, a rod, and a lever on the knee](images/big/knee_crank.png)

- **Size:** 1.797 m tall, 96.3 kg from every part's material, 22 actuators (19 RS04, 2 RS03, 1 RS00). Masses lean on assumed pocketing: no pockets are drawn.
- **Knee:** two RS04s, each with a crank, a rod and a lever, in place of a roller chain. 1.54:1 at its weakest, about 3.4:1 at the straight end, over 70 degrees.
- **Given up:** deep squat and floor pick, as the crank's range won't reach them; the head roll, for a lighter neck.
- **Strength against real humanoids,** peak torque over (weight x leg length), read from their own URDFs: knee 0.56 and hips 0.36 are in the range of
  Unitree's G1, H1-2 and H2 and AgiBot's X2 and A3 (0.35-0.65), and ankle 0.18 is above Unitree's. Hip yaw, 0.18, is about half most of theirs, and it has no ankle roll, which they all do.

**Can it walk?** Slowly, in simulation. All of this needs help the small ducks didn't: a stepping clock. Scaled correctly, with no clock, it learned to stand still.
- [The walk in this video](images/big/big_walk.mp4) (MP4, 8 s) reaches about 0.33 m/s told 0.4, but overloads its knee: 170 N m RMS against 123 rated.
- With a penalty for sustained overload, at iteration 1500 of 3000, every joint is under its rating at 0.3-0.4 m/s (knee 99 N m), on a straighter leg, and all 32 test robots stay up.
  The cost is speed: 0.20 m/s told 0.4, 0.04 m/s backward told 0.2. It drifts sideways at about 0.12 m/s whatever it's told, and barely answers sideways commands. That run wasn't finished when this was written.
- Not done: stress analysis, reading the RS04's real CAD and measuring one, the chain's tensioner, the rods moving in the model, how it survives a fall. Wiring and the Fusion model are a first pass, with their flaws listed.

## Status

A design, not yet built. Nothing here has been printed or tested on real parts. Fusion models so far: hybrid and [all Dynamixel](dynamixel/BOM.md), in [cad/](../cad/). milli has STS3215 ankles; branch
`xc330-ankle` keeps the version with Dynamixel XC330 ankles, before the strength and printing work.

- **Size:** 0.321 m tall, 1.59 kg from every part's material (microduck: 0.264 m, 0.8 kg). The STS3215s set the scale;
  the proportions are checked against microduck's at that scale.
- **Joints:** 15, as microduck's: each leg hip yaw, roll, pitch, knee, ankle; neck pitch, head pitch, yaw, roll, beak.
- **Bearings, as microduck's:** a thin bearing round each horn, on the joint's axis, in place of a fork round the servo.
- **Foot switches:** a microswitch in each shoe, as an input to a walking policy, as Open Duck Mini's.
- **The Fusion model:** built from the spec, one body per printed part with its holes and pockets, 15 joints, each part checked point by point against its STL: [cad/duck-droids-hybrid.f3d](../cad/duck-droids-hybrid.f3d), [.step](../cad/duck-droids-hybrid.step), [picture](images/fusion/fusion_34.png). The build video above is from before this round.
- **Printable parts:** STLs with their screw holes and pockets in [prints/](../prints/hybrid/README.md), left and right, turned the way they should print. Strength so far is a hand estimate: print one joint first.
- **Head limits:** head roll over 0.1 rad only while head yaw is under 0.5 rad, or the head meets the yaw servo. The head pitch XL330 can pass through, but not hold, the head forward and down.
- **Open:** a power switch, speaker and microphone, and retraining: the servo cases are 3 mm thinner than the walks were trained on, the model 90 g heavier, with wider thighs.
