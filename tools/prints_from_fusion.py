"""Replace prints/<variant>/*.stl with what the Fusion model actually is: its fillets and curved covers, which the offline meshes don't have.

  python -I tools/prints_from_fusion.py          (after cad/fusion/full_build.py has written its raw STLs; MILLI_RECIPE picks the variant)

Each body is turned as tools/export_prints.py chose to print it (print_T in spec/parts_<variant>.json). A file is replaced only if it is one piece, watertight
and within 12 % of the offline volume: rounding takes some away, and more than that means the body went wrong. Anything refused keeps its offline STL, and is named.
